This plugin configures `JavaCompile` tasks to use the [Checker Framework](https://checkerframework.org).
It is a fork of the original plugin built by [jaredsburrows](https://github.com/jaredsburrows/gradle-checker-framework-plugin).

## Download

Add the following to your `build.gradle` file (you will probably need to modify the `plugins`
block):

**Release:**
```groovy
plugins {
    // Checker Framework build logic
    id 'org.checkerframework' version '0.2.0'
}

apply plugin: 'org.checkerframework'
```

## Using a locally-built plugin

To build the plugin from source, run `./gradlew build`.

If you want to use a locally-built version of the plugin, you can publish the plugin to your
local Maven repository by running `./gradlew publish`. In the `build.gradle` file for each
project for which you want to use the locally-built plugin, make sure that `mavenLocal()`
is the first entry in the `repositories` block within the `buildscript` block. A full example
will look like this:

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    mavenLocal()
  }
  
  dependencies {
    classpath 'gradle.plugin.org.checkerframework:checkerframework-gradle-plugin:0.2.0-SNAPSHOT'
  }
}

apply plugin: 'org.checkerframework'
```

## Configuration

### Configuring which checkers to use

The `checkerFramework.checkers` property lists which checkers will be run.

For example:

```groovy
checkerFramework {
  checkers = [
    'org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.NullnessChecker',
    'org.checkerframework.checker.units.UnitsChecker'
  ]
}
```

For a list of checkers, see the [Checker Framework Manual](https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction).

### Providing checker-specific options to the compiler

You can set the `checkerFramework.extraJavacArgs` property in order to pass additional options to the compiler when running
a typechecker.

For example, to use a stub file:

```groovy
checkerFramework {
  extraJavacArgs = [
    '-Astubs=/path/to/my/stub/file.astub'
  ]
}
```

### Configuring third-party checkers

To use a third-party typechecker (i.e. one that is not distributed with the Checker Framework),
add a dependency to the `checkerFramework` dependency configuration.

For example, to use the [Glacier](http://mcoblenz.github.io/Glacier/) immutability checker:

```groovy
dependencies {
  ...
  checkerFramework 'edu.cmu.cs.glacier:glacier:0.1'
}
```

### Other options

By default, the plugin applies the selected checkers to all `JavaCompile` targets.
The plugin includes a rudimentary option for preventing checkers from being applied
to test targets. To use it, add the following to the `checkerFramework` block:

```groovy
checkerFramework {
  excludeTests = true
}
```

The check for test targets is entirely syntactic: this option will not apply the checkers
to any task whose name includes "test", ignoring case. The default value is `false`.
